Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Bad IAM Role and Policy definition. 
The to access the recipes and the attack similation is the same. A role should have access only to what is meant to do.

# Poor practice 2
Bad Security Access to Cloud Infrastructure.
The applications shouldn't be deployed into a public subnet because this leaves the environment open to exploitation.
